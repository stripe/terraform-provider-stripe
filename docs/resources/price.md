  Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and one-time purchases of products. Products https://stripe.com/docs/api#products help you track inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by prices.

# stripe_price (Resource)

Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and one-time purchases of products. [Products](https://stripe.com/docs/api#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by prices. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme. For example, you might have a single \"gold\" product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year, and €9 once. Related guides: [Set up a subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription), [create an invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/create), and more about [products and prices](https://stripe.com/docs/products-prices/overview).

## Schema

### Required

- `currency` (String) Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).

### Optional

- `active` (Boolean) Whether the price can be used for new purchases. Defaults to `true`.
- `billing_scheme` (String) Describes how to compute the price per period. Either `per_unit` or `tiered`. `per_unit` indicates that the fixed amount (specified in `unit_amount` or `unit_amount_decimal`) will be charged per unit in `quantity` (for prices with `usage_type=licensed`), or per unit of total usage (for prices with `usage_type=metered`). `tiered` indicates that the unit pricing will be computed using a tiering strategy as defined using the `tiers` and `tiers_mode` attributes.
- `currency_options` (Block List) Prices defined in each available currency option. Each key must be a three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) and a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--currency_options))
- `custom_unit_amount` (Block List, Max: 1) When set, provides configuration for the amount to be adjusted by the customer during Checkout Sessions and Payment Links. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--custom_unit_amount))
- `lookup_key` (String) A lookup key used to retrieve prices dynamically from a static string. This may be up to 200 characters.
- `metadata` (Map of String) Set of [key-value pairs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.
- `nickname` (String) A brief description of the price, hidden from customers.
- `product` (String) The ID of the [Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) that this [Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) will belong to.
- `recurring` (Block List, Max: 1) The recurring components of a price such as `interval` and `usage_type`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--recurring))
- `tax_behavior` (String) Only required if a [default tax behavior](https://stripe.com/docs/tax/products-prices-tax-categories-tax-behavior#setting-a-default-tax-behavior-(recommended)) was not provided in the Stripe Tax settings. Specifies whether the price is considered inclusive of taxes or exclusive of taxes. One of `inclusive`, `exclusive`, or `unspecified`. Once specified as either `inclusive` or `exclusive`, it cannot be changed.
- `tiers` (Block List) Each element represents a pricing tier. This parameter requires `billing_scheme` to be set to `tiered`. See also the documentation for `billing_scheme`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--tiers))
- `tiers_mode` (String) Defines if the tiering price should be `graduated` or `volume` based. In `volume`-based tiering, the maximum quantity within a period determines the per unit price, in `graduated` tiering pricing can successively change as the quantity grows.
- `unit_amount` (Number) A positive integer in cents (or local equivalent) (or 0 for a free price) representing how much to charge. One of `unit_amount`, `unit_amount_decimal`, or `custom_unit_amount` is required, unless `billing_scheme=tiered`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

### Nested Schema for `recurring`

Required:

- `interval` (String) Specifies billing frequency. Either `day`, `week`, `month` or `year`.

Optional:

- `interval_count` (Number) The number of intervals between subscription billings. For example, `interval=month` and `interval_count=3` bills every 3 months. Maximum of three years interval allowed (3 years, 36 months, or 156 weeks).
- `meter` (String) The meter tracking the usage of a metered price
- `trial_period_days` (Number) Default number of trial days when subscribing a customer to this price using [`trial_from_plan=true`](https://stripe.com/docs/api#create_subscription-trial_from_plan).
- `usage_type` (String) Configures how the quantity per period should be determined. Can be either `metered` or `licensed`. `licensed` automatically bills the `quantity` set when adding it to a subscription. `metered` aggregates the total usage based on usage records. Defaults to `licensed`.
