# stripe_billing_meter (Resource)

Meters specify how to aggregate meter events over a billing period. Meter events represent the actions that customers take in your system. Meters attach to prices and form the basis of the bill. Related guide: [Usage based billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based)



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `default_aggregation` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) The default settings to aggregate a meter's events with. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--default_aggregation))
- `display_name` (String) The meter’s name. Not visible to the customer.
- `event_name` (String) The name of the meter event to record usage for. Corresponds with the `event_name` field on meter events.

### Optional

- `customer_mapping` (Block List, Max: 1) Fields that specify how to map a meter event to a customer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--customer_mapping))
- `dimension_payload_keys` (List of String) Set of keys that will be used to group meter events by. Each key must be present in the event payload.
- `event_time_window` (String) The time window which meter events have been pre-aggregated for, if any.
- `value_settings` (Block List, Max: 1) Fields that specify how to calculate a meter event's value. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--value_settings))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--default_aggregation"></a>
### Nested Schema for `default_aggregation`

Required:

- `formula` (String) Specifies how events are aggregated. Allowed values are `count` to count the number of events, `sum` to sum each event's value and `last` to take the last event's value in the window.


<a id="nestedblock--customer_mapping"></a>
### Nested Schema for `customer_mapping`

Required:

- `event_payload_key` (String) The key in the meter event payload to use for mapping the event to a customer.
- `type` (String) The method for mapping a meter event to a customer. Must be `by_id`.


<a id="nestedblock--value_settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `value_settings`

Optional:

- `event_payload_key` (String) The key in the usage event payload to use as the value for this meter. For example, if the event payload contains usage on a `bytes_used` field, then set the event_payload_key to \"bytes_used\".
